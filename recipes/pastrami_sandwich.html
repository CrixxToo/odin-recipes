    <h3>The best homemade pastrami sandwich</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        This peerless pastrami sandwich was adapted from a menu favorite at Primanti Bros. Restaurant in Pittsburgh. We took the basic ingredients—grilled cold cuts, cheese, fried potatoes and tomatoes—and created a tasty replica that includes our version of their secret coleslaw topping. —Taste of Home Test Kitchen
